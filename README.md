# Server utility

In many projects, unnecessary libraries get added, making the code heavier and harder to maintain. That's why I've decided to use a custom set of utilities in my projects. These utilities have no dependencies and are easy to read, which greatly enhances code security.

- ** validate ** ![See more...](./libs/validate/README.md)
- time/ - constants for time (seconds, minute ...)
- jwt/ - generate JWT token from object you can also configurate this on jwt.config.[js|ts]
- passwordUtils/ - utils for hashing and checking password
